The idea looks like this:
Every kde-l10n package gets build individually from a common branch, for each backage the branch gets merged with the source and a substituation occurs of language code and language name, thus making the debian/ content language specific.
For this to work it is important that especially the language name is always placed in a way that prevents it from exceeding 80 chars/line in all scenarios.
